  ## Description
  I used javascript and SQL to create an employee tracker for a financial services company. I first created options to prompt the user to view/add/update departments, roles, and employees. Then I used the SQL package to write the inputs to the sql being displayed in the terminal. I struggled with SQL but was able to overcome these difficulties with some time. The server.js file was also lengthy.
